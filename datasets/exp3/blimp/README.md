I ran the script `python make_corpus.py` to create the final `corpus.csv` file, which allows for comparisons
of full-sentence probabilities. It contains 30 randomly sampled items from 13 different categories in the full BLIMP test set.

To run the script, you need to first download the raw files from the full BLiMP dataset. 
To do this, download the BLiMP.zip file from 
[here](https://github.com/alexwarstadt/blimp/blob/master/BLiMP.zip), and place the `.jsonl` files in a folder named `raw`.
