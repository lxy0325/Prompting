The original file `clean_DTFit_human_dat.csv` was downloaded from [https://github.com/carina-kauf/lm-event-knowledge/blob/main/analyses/clean_data/clean_DTFit_human_dat.csv](https://github.com/carina-kauf/lm-event-knowledge/blob/main/analyses/clean_data/clean_DTFit_human_dat.csv) on March 22, 2023.

Please see [Kauf, Ivanova et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01488) for more details. Here is a description from their paper about human scores:
```
Human judgments for Dataset 2 had been previously collected by Vassallo et al.
(2018) on Prolific, a web-based platform for collecting behavioral data. Participants in this
experiment answered questions of the form “How common is it for an actor to win an award?” on
a Likert scale from 1 (very atypical) to 7 (very typical). 
```
The data are originally from [Vassallo et al. (2018)](http://lrec-conf.org/workshops/lrec2018/W9/pdf/5_W9.pdf).

The final `corpus.csv` file was created by running the script `python make_corpus.py`.
